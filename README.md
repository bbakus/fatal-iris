This project is inspired my true love, Isabelle.

My current thought is to create a roguelite simulator, where the user is presented with four doors:
Violet, Blue, Red and Yellow, after the colors of the iris. In each door lies a series of puzzles
that must completed before moving on to the next room. Some events are timed, others have a series
of events. And some offer choices for a reward, that can help you in future rooms, or sometimes
for entirely different colored rooms. All the puzzle events will be AI generated, some will be riddles
Maybe the 'plot' is uncovering a death/murder? Ideally each rooom would be set to just basic mouse events
and text entry, or keydown events. it might be awesome if it was all text input. Maybe the correct inputs
are what lead you to clues? hmm, what distinguishes these rooms/routes from eachother. Should they merge?
do they all culminate to the same climax? What's the point of the four unique paths?
Maybe they aren't paths. maybe each door just leads to one room, and it's all to solve one single riddle.
each room gives you a clue, and after diving into each one, you have three attempts to solve the riddle.
hmm maybe. Maybe each door is a level, only the blue one opens first. failure in any of the doors means 
restarting from the beginning. Maybe you get to keep an item, or something.
okay so maybe a murder mystery, the killer leaves an iris on his victims. each room examines each victims
lives right before the murder, like a time capsule of sorts.












# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This project is inspired my true love, Isabelle.

The intitial readme was very much just a sandbox of ideas, but now that the project is finished I can
give it a proper introduction. Welcome to Fatal Iris, a murder mystery game where you traverse through
four different rooms, finding clues with a mouseHover effect, clicking the button, inspecting the clue,
reading the further investigation when the clue is in your inventory, and ultimately taking a swing
at solving the mystery. Getting this together was very difficult, and took a lot of persistence to learn
the things I needed in order to flesh this out programmatically. Overall I think it's turned out quite wonderful, and I would gather to say that I'm proud of it. The functionality, the styling, the story;
all of it took countless attempts, with so many failures until I could get it right. I hope you enjoy playing it, I honestly have no idea how difficult it may be. Perhaps after seeing someone go into it blind, I can tweak some of the clues, maybe change the button size to be more generous, etc...

Have fun, detective.












# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
